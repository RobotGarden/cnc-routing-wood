== CNC Milling

_mill_::
a machine that manufactures by the continuous repetition of some simple action

We have two tools available for cutting parts out of wood:

. The link:http://www.cncrouterparts.com/pro4848-4-x-4-cnc-router-kit-p-251.html[Pro 4848 CNC Router]

. The link:http://carbide3d.com/nomad/[Nomad 883 Pro]

These machines are similar, and may both be called _CNC mills_. This
class introduces the Pro 4848, a 4'x4' machine that is more often called
a _CNC router_, because is it based on an off-the-shelf router rather
than a more flexible _milling spindle_ that has a wider range of
rotational speeds. The Pro 4848 is often more suitable for wood because
of its larger work area.

=== Milling vs. 3D Printing

Perhaps the best way to introduce CNC Milling concepts is to compare
them with 3D printing.

* Rather than building up the model layer-by-layer, milling a part
using the CNC router is _subtractive manufacturing_ -- you are cutting
away portions of the _stock_ to create an approximation of the model.
It is much more an approximation of the original model than when 3D
printing.

* In 3D printing, there are options to control the layer height, the
infill, and so on, but those options don't fundamentally change what
is printed. When using the CNC, on the other hand, you can choose
tool paths based on the model that could cause drastic differences in
what is cut.

* 3D printing has to print from bottom to top. In CNC milling, there are
more choices about the order in which the cuts are made.

* The 3D printer only lays down cylinders of plastic. The CNC has
different bits to choose from that take away different amounts _and
different shapes_ of material, and pull on the material in different ways.

=== 2D vs. 2-1/2 D vs. 3D Milling

Many parts and models consist of flat surfaces at different heights.
Milling of these parts is called 2-1/2 D. Models that have curved
surfaces, either convex or concave, require 3D milling. Milling curved
surfaces requires different kinds of tool paths. You can select them in
Fusion 360, but they are  beyond the scope of this
intro.

== 3D Models for Milling

You can create models for milling using any 3D modeling program.
However, using Fusion 360 to create tool paths is easier if the 3D
solids are built using Fusion.

When 3D printing, it's easy to grab STL files from sites like
Thingiverse and then print them using any slicing tool. Unfortunately,
it's harder to get models for milling. In particular, it's hard to
take STL files and then create tool paths, because of the difference
in structure between STLs and other types of models. For this reason,
you either need to use Fusion 360 to create the models, or export models
from other tools using a standard format such as IGES or STEP.

== GCode for Control of the Milling Machine

_GCode_ is the programming language used to control the CNC machine.
This language is shared with the 3D printing world. Some commands differ,
however, because of the different ways to control the tool. GCode
commands unique to CNC milling include:

* Control of the spindle speed -- Ignored with the Pro 4848 since you
have to control the spindle speed by a dial on the router.

* Tool selection -- Commands to allow the operator to change the bit
during the milling program.

== From Model to Tool Paths

=== Fusion 360 Modes

The leftmost dropdown in the Fusion 360 toolbar allows you to choose
among the various editing modes. Different features are available in
different modes. The most important for creating models and creating
tool paths are _Model_ and _CAM_.

image:fusion360-modes.png[Fusion 360 Modes Dropdown]

Model::
Used to create sketches and objects.

CAM::
Used to create tool paths to cut away stock to generate the model.

=== Creating a Setup

Once you move into the _CAM_ mode, you need to start by creating a
_Setup_, that is, a relationship between your model and the _stock_,
the piece of wood you are going to cut from. To create a setup, select
_New Setup_ from the _Setup_ dropdown.

image:new-setup.png[Creating a New Setup]

The three most important things to specify are:

* Stock size -- Placing the model into the material
* Coordinate system -- Stock orientation and bit zero point
* Postprocessing -- Program Name, to set default file name

==== Specifying the Stock Size

In the _Stock_ tab of the New Setup dialog, you specify the size of the
stock in relation to the model. The default relationship is
_Relative size box_. This allows you 

=== Adding a Tool Path

You can add tool paths to the setup using the 2D and 3D dropdowns, or by
right-clicking on the setup and selecting _New Operation_ and selecting
an operation in that popup menu.

For the purposes of this class, we'll stick to three kinds of paths:
_Face_, _2D Pocket_, and _2D Contour_. These tool paths are suitable
for these purposes:

_Face_::
Planing a surface to a uniform depth. This can be used to shave off
material when the stock is thicker than your model. The path used to
perform a _Face_ operation will move the bit back and forth over the
area to be faced.

_2D Pocket_::
This tool path is used to cut material down to a flat surface in the
model. This can be used either for an interior hole or other flat
face in the model. The pocket can cut all the way through the stock
or only partway. The path used to cut the pocket will be a spiral, or
perhaps multiple spirals. You can also choose to cut in multiple steps,
rather than all in one operation.

_2D Contour_::
This tool path is used to cut along an edge. Much like 2D Pocket, you can
cut down to a desired depth in one step or multiple steps. 2D Contour is
often used to cut out parts from the stock.

=== Controls for Tool Paths

The dialog used to add a tool path has several tabs that are the same,
no matter the type of path selected.

* Tool -- The tool to use and the speeds (spindle rotation rate and linear speed)
* Geometry -- Which faces or lines to cut, and any adjustments to the cut geometry
* Heights -- The depth of cut, among other heights
* Passses -- Whether to make multiple cuts, and stock to leave behind
* Linking -- How to start and end the cut

=== Speeds and Feeds

This tab allows you to select the bit to use and the speeds used when
cutting the path.

image:tool-speeds.png[Tool Feeds and Speeds]

The machine deals with two speed controls:

_Spindle Speed_::
The rotation rate of the router spindle, in RPM.

_Cutting Feedrate_::
The linear speed at which the spindle is moved through the stock.

However, these two rates are dependent on the bit size and the number of
flutes. It is easier to
work with two other parameters that are independent of the bit size:

_Surface Speed_::
This is the linear speed at which the cutting edge moves through the
stock, measured in either ft/minute or meters/minute.
The ideal surface speed varies with the material and the tool.
Wood has a large range of acceptable surface speeds. A starting point
suggested by one source is 1100 ft/minute. For small bit sizes this
is faster than is achievable.

_Feed per Tooth_::
Also known as _chip load_. The amount of material cut away by one pass of
one flute. This also varies based on the material and the tool. Wood has
a large range of acceptable chip loads, up to about 0.03" (=0.76mm).

In general, for 1/8" bits you can run at the maximum, 25,000 RPM. For 1/4"
bits a slower speed is probably needed, 16,500 RPM is a reasonable
default.

=== Geometry

image:geometry.png[Geometry of the Tool Path]

This tab allows you to select the portions of the model used to generate
the tool path. For facing or 2D pocket operations, you select a face
in the model. For 2D contour operations you select an edge.

When selecting an edge, you choose an entire closed path, by default.
If you want to select only a portion of an edge, hold down the Option or
Alt key when clicking on the path.

The other main thing to select in the Geometry tab is whether to leave
_tabs_ connecting the cut to the rest of the part. This is used for
2D pocket tool paths when cutting out the part from the rest of the stock.

=== Heights

In this tab you choose the various heights at which the tool operates.
The most important, in fact the only one you usually need to adjust,
is the _Bottom Height_.

=== Passes

In this tab you control whether the cut happens in one step or multiple
steps. You can also control the _Stock to Leave_. By default the 2D
Pocket tool path leaves a little stock behind. If you don't want this,
uncheck _Stock to Leave_.

==== Roughing vs. Finishing

Larger values of _Feed per Tooth_ make the job run faster but can cause
a lower quality surface finish. To run faster with high quality you can
use two paths in a row: a roughing pass with larger feed per tooth, and
then a finishing pass with lower feed per tooth.

For the purposes of this class, we'll try to do everything in one pass.

=== Linking

This tab is used to control how this tool path is connected to the
adjacent paths, as well as how this path is entered. The most important
considerations are probably:

How the initial depth is reached::
By default, for 2D Pocket operations Fusion 360 will choose to slowly
reach the target depth using a helical path. This is quite slot and
unneeded for wood. For wood you should usually choose _Plunge_.

Lead-in and lead-out::
Fusion likes to ease into a cut from an angle. Normally this is fine.
However, occasionally you may want to disable lead-in and lead-out to
avoid cutting adjacent areas of the stock.

=== Changing Bits or Router Speeds

If you select a different bit for a new tool path, the program will
automatically stop to let you change the bit. If you want to change
the speed only, you need to insert a _force tool change_ operation
into the program. Right-click on the setup and select _New Operation_
> _Manual NC_, then select a _Force tool change_ operation.

=== Other Features

Reorder the tool paths::
You can use drag-and-drop to reorder the tool paths within a program.

Multiple setups::
You can create multiple setups with different tool paths. Each setup
can be exported to a separate GCode file.

== Simulating the Tool Paths

When you select either the setup or a single toolpath, you can similate
the operation by pressing the simulate button.

image:simulate-button.png[The Simulate Button]

Within the simulation you can turn on or off the view of the stock or
toolpaths. You can also control the speed of the simulation, or even jump
forward to the end to see what was cut out of the stock.

The _Statistics_ tab can be used to see a summary of how long it will
take to run the program.

== Exporting GCode

Once you are ready to export GCode to disk, press the _Post Process_
button.

image:post-process.png[Post-processing]

In the Post Process dialog you can select the machine you are generating
GCode for and set the program name, which becomes the default GCode
file name.

=== File Extensions

The default file extension for the 4'x4' router is _.tap_. However,
within Mach3 you can load a file with any extension by using options
in the file dialog.

The Nomad 883 uses a different file extension.

== Running a Program

=== Holding Down Your Work

There are several options for holding down your work:

* (Easiest) Use deck screws into the spoilboard. For harder woods,
pre-drill the holes.

* Double-stick tape. There are two kinds near the Nomad. I've had luck
with this technique for plywood and thin wood, but Jim has had
failures with thicker stock.

* Hold-down clamps. I've made four from mending plates, and I'm planning
on milling some from oak. There are several commercial varieties.

==== Cutting Completely Around a Model

You can cut a model completely out of the stock, but you have to take
care to hold the model in place as you finish cutting it out. I've tried
three things:

Leaving "tabs" on the model::
In Fusion 360, you can cut a contour while leaving small tabs that
connect the model to the rest of the stock. In other words, you don't
actually cut the model out completely. You can remove the tabs using
a wood chisel or metal snips.

Double-stock tape::
If the amount of wood you are cutting in the last step is small, there
will be little torque on the stock, so double-stick tape can keep the
model stuck to the table. This might only work for models that aren't
very thick.

Moving clamps::
You can cut part-way around the model, then apply a clamp, crossing
the perimeter where you've already cut, then cut the rest of the way.

Screws through the model::
If you have areas in the model where you can mill or pre-drill holes,
you can screw the stock down both outside the model and inside the model.

=== Important: Zeroing the Axes

To run a program you need to load the GCode, then zero the axes. Once
that is done you press the "Start program" button to run the GCode.
It is very important that you ensure the axes are zeroed correctly.
Failure to zero the axes can cause you to cut the wrong portion of the
stock.

=== Milling More Than One Copy

To mill another copy of a model, move the bit to the new X and Y zero
position and re-zero both axes. You should not have to re-zero Z, but
it doesn't hurt. Then start the program again.

=== What Can Go Wrong

* Failure to zero the axes -- it's easy to move the spindle to the zero
point and then forget to press "Zero X" and "Zero Y". To avoid this, move
the head back to the zero point after zeroing the axes to make sure X,
Y, and Z coordinates are near zero. _This is really easy to get wrong!_

* Bit not firmly attached -- 1/8" bits are harder to secure in the collet
than bits with larger shanks. Make sure the bit is 80% of the way into
the collet.

* Jammed bit -- the MDF wood of the spoilboard doesn't cut very well.
Instead of making chips it mills into powder. Downcut bits don't clear
this powder very well, so it's possible to cut too deeply into the
spoilboard and jam the bit. To avoid this, don't cut too deeply below
the bottom of the stock. Usually 1mm is sufficient to guarantee that
you are cutting all the way through the stock.

* Stock not level -- The spoilboard is soft and can compress
a bit, possibly making your stock non-level. In addition, as portions of
the spoilboard are cut away, it can become more compressible. If you need
the stock to be very level, check the stock alignment by moving the bit
around with constant Z, making sure the clearance above the stock is
uniform. You might have to clamp portions of the stock harder to level it.

=== Recovering From Problems

Stopping the Mill::
Use the "stop program" button, the "Emergency Stop" Mach3 button,
or the red safety stop button.

Rewinding the Program::
There is a "rewind" button in Mach3. You have to stop the program first.

== Sample Models for Milling

Here are a couple of sample models that are suitable for 2-1/2 D milling.
