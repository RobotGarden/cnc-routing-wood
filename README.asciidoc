== CNC Routing

Perhaps the best way to introduce CNC Routing concepts is to compare
them with 3D printing.

* Rather than building up the model layer-by-layer, creating a part
using the CNC router is _subtractive manufacturing_ -- you are cutting
away portions of the _stock_ to create an approximation of the model.
It is much more an approximation of the original model than when 3D
printing.

* In 3D printing, there are options to control the layer height, the
infill, and so on, but those options don't fundamentally change what
is printed. When using the CNC, on the other hand, you can choose
toolpaths based on the model that could cause drastic differences in
what is cut.

* 3D printing has to print from bottom to top. In CNC milling, there are
more choices about the order in which the cuts are made.

* The 3D printer only lays down cylinders of plastic. The CNC has
different bits to choose from that take away different amounts _and
different shapes_ of material, and pull on the material in different ways.

== From Model to Toolpaths

=== Fusion 360 Modes

The leftmost dropdown in the Fusion 360 toolbar allows you to choose
among the various editing modes. Different features are available in
different modes. The most important for creating models and creating
toolpaths are _Model_ and _CAM_.

Model::
Used to create sketches and objects.

CAM::
Used to create toolpaths to cut away stock to generate the model.

=== Creating a Setup

Once you move into the _CAM_ mode, you need to start by creating a
_Setup_, that is, a relationship between your model and the _stock_,
the piece of wood you are going to cut from. To create a setup, select
_New Setup_ from the _Setup_ dropdown.

The three most important things to specify are:

* Stock size -- Placing the model into the material
* Coordinate system -- Stock orientation and bit zero point
* Postprocessing -- Program Name, to set default file name

==== Specifying the Stock Size

In the _Stock_ tab of the New Setup dialog, you specify the size of the
stock in relation to the model. The default relationship is
_Relative size box_. This allows you 

=== Adding a Toolpath

* Tool -- The tool to use and the speeds (spindle rotation rate and linear speed)
* Geometry -- Which faces or lines to cut, and any adjustments to the cut geometry
* Heights -- The depth of cut, among other heights
* Passses -- Whether to make multiple cuts, and stock to leave behind
* Linking -- How to start and end the cut

== Running a Program

=== What Can Go Wrong

* Failure to zero the axes
* Bit not firmly attached
* Jammed bit

== CNC Router 4848 Operation

=== Machine Set-Up

. Safety glasses
. (optional) Dust mask
. Router power off
. CNC power on and motor enable
. Log on to PC (password "4848")
. Start Mach3, choosing "4848" profile.
. Press "Reset" to take Mach3 out of emergency stop mode.
. Press "Ref All Home" to calibrate CNC axes.

=== Loading Stock and Bit

. (optional) Pre-drill hold-down holes in stock using drill press or hand drill.
. In Mach3, load GCode.
. Move router head out of the way using arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn.
. Screw down or otherwise hold down stock.
. Move router head to convenient location for loading bit.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Press-snap collet into holder.
. Screw collet and holder onto spindle loosely.
. Load bit, 80% into collet, and tighten with collet wrenches.
. Move bit to program origin. (Often helpful to lower bit near stock surface.)
. Zero X and Y.
. Move bit up enough to clear Z sensor, and above flat spot on stock.
. Place Z sensor under bit and attach ground wire to bit shank.
. Press "Auto Tool Zero" to zero Z.
. Remove ground wire and stow Z sensor under table.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Select router speed.
. Router power on.

=== Running Program

Ensure that:

* Router power is on and router speed is set.
* Vacuum skirt is attached.
* You know where the "Stop" button is in case you need to stop the program.

To start exhaust vacuum and start program:

. Open exhaust vacuum valve above CNC and close other valve.
. Turn on exhaust vacuum.
. Ear protection.
. Press "Start" to start program.
. Press "Start" to continue after first tool selection.

=== Changing Bits

When program pauses for tool change:

. Router power off.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Remove bit using collet wrenches.
. (if changing collet size) Snap out old collet and snap in new collet.
. Install collet and holder loosely.
. Load bit 80% into collet and tighten.
. Move bit up enough to clear Z sensor, and above flat spot on stock.
. Place Z sensor under bit and attach ground wire to bit shank.
. Press "Auto Tool Zero" to zero Z.
. Remove ground wire and stow Z sensor under table.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Select router speed.
. Router power on.
. Press "Start" to continue program.

=== Shutting Down

. Router power off.
. Remove stock from table.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Remove bit and collet.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Move router head out of the way so you can vacuum up dust.
. Exit Mach3.
. CNC motor disable and power off.
. Change vacuum valves for using vacuum hose.
. Vacuum dust off table and floor.
. Turn off exhaust vacuum.
