. Safety glasses
. Router power off
. CNC power on and motor enable
. Log on to PC (password "4848")
. Start Mach3, choosing "4848" profile.
. Press "Reset" to take Mach3 out of emergency stop mode.
. Press "Ref All Home" to calibrate CNC axes.

=== Loading Stock and Bit

. (optional) Pre-drill hold-down holes in stock using drill press or hand drill.
. In Mach3, load GCode.
. Move router head out of the way using arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn.
. Screw down or otherwise hold down stock.
. Move router head to convenient location for loading bit.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Press-snap collet into holder.
. Screw collet and holder onto spindle loosely.
. Load bit, 80% into collet, and tighten with collet wrenches.
. Move bit to program origin. (Often helpful to lower bit near stock surface.)
. Zero X and Y.
. Move bit up enough to clear Z sensor, and above flat spot on stock.
. Place Z sensor under bit and attach ground wire to bit shank.
. Press "Auto Tool Zero" to zero Z.
. Remove ground wire and stow Z sensor under table.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Select router speed.
. Router power on.

=== Running Program

Ensure that:

* Router power is on and router speed is set.
* Vacuum skirt is attached.
* You know where the "Stop" button is in case you need to stop the program.

To start exhaust vacuum and start program:

. Open exhaust vacuum valve above CNC and close other valve.
. Turn on exhaust vacuum.
. Ear protection.
. Press "Start" to start program.
. Press "Start" to continue after first tool selection.

=== Changing Bits

When program pauses for tool change:

. Router power off.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Remove bit using collet wrenches.
. (if changing collet size) Snap out old collet and snap in new collet.
. Install collet and holder loosely.
. Load bit 80% into collet and tighten.
. Move bit up enough to clear Z sensor, and above flat spot on stock.
. Place Z sensor under bit and attach ground wire to bit shank.
. Press "Auto Tool Zero" to zero Z.
. Remove ground wire and stow Z sensor under table.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Select router speed.
. Router power on.
. Press "Start" to continue program.

=== Shutting Down

. Router power off.
. Remove stock from table.
. Remove vacuum skirt.
. Remove bit and collet.
. Attach vacuum skirt.
. Move router head out of the way so you can vacuum up dust.
. Exit Mach3.
. CNC motor disable and power off.
. Change vacuum valves for using vacuum hose.
. Vacuum dust off table and floor.
. Turn off exhaust vacuum.
